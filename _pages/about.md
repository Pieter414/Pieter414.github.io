## Pieter Christy Yan Yudhistira

I am a Computer Science student at Brawijaya University, currently in my third year. I serve as the Head Coordinator of the Intelligent System Laboratory Assistant Researchers at the Faculty of Computer Science. Mostly surviving on vibes, managed to maintain perfect GPA for four consecutive semesters tho... somehow.

I’m broadly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I don’t stick to a single niche tbh. Computer Vision, NLP, LLM, RAG, GNNs, and anything else that catches my curiosity are all fair game.

Most of my university life revolves around classes and lab work, usually focused on completing course projects rather than doing actual research. I am also a Data Scientist and Analyst in the Basic Computing Community (BCC), knowned for being overly analytical and finding interesting (but usually useless) insight on piles of information.

I’ve participated in several machine learning and data science competitions. My proudest achievement so far is becoming a finalist in the Data Mining category at Gemastik 2025, 4th place on FIT Competition 2025 and DAC ITS 2024. Yeah, never the winner but always the angels.

### Research

Currently trying to have my research published, wish me luck. But had research about Graph Neural Network on fraud detection, leaf disease detection on actual coffee leafs from UB forests, medical chatbot using Langgraph, and several competition related research.
